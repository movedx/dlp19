    "Welcome to the fourth assignment. In this assignment, you will:\n",
    "1. Learn to use Keras, a high-level neural networks API (programming framework), written in Python and capable of running on top of several lower-level frameworks including TensorFlow and CNTK. \n",
    "2. See how you can build a deep learning model in a very short time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why are we using Keras? Keras was developed to enable building and experimenting with different models very quickly. Just as TensorFlow is a higher-level API than CUDA and numpy, Keras is an even higher-level framework that provides additional abstractions. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to finding good models. However, Keras is more restrictive than the lower-level frameworks, so there are some complex models that you can implement in TensorFlow but not (or at least not with added difficulty) in Keras. That being said, Keras will work fine for many common tasks!"
